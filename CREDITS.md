CssMin is a css parser and minfier. It minifies css by removing unneeded
whitespace character, comments, empty blocks and empty declarations. In addition
declaration values can get rewritten to shorter notation if available.

JSmin
-----

Website: http://code.google.com/p/jsmin-php/

JSMin is a filter which removes comments and unnecessary whitespace from
JavaScript files. It typically reduces filesize by half, resulting in faster
downloads. It also encourages a more expressive programming style because it
eliminates the download cost of clean, literate self-documentation.
